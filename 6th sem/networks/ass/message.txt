This  is  an  implementation of the User Datagram Protocol described in
RFC 768.  It implements a connectionless,  unreliable  datagram  packet
service.   Packets  may  be reordered or duplicated before they arrive.
UDP generates and checks checksums to catch transmission errors.

When a UDP socket is  created,  its  local  and  remote  addresses  are
unspecified.   Datagrams  can  be  sent  immediately using sendto(2) or
sendmsg(2) with a valid destination address as an argument.  When  con‐
nect(2) is called on the socket, the default destination address is set
and datagrams can now be sent using send(2) or write(2) without  speci‐
fying  a  destination  address.   It is still possible to send to other
destinations by passing an address  to  sendto(2)  or  sendmsg(2).   In
order  to  receive  packets, the socket can be bound to a local address
first by using bind(2).  Otherwise the socket layer will  automatically
assign   a   free   local   port   out   of   the   range   defined  by
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range   and   bind   the   socket   to
INADDR_ANY.
